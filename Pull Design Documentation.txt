Pull Design Documentation

View
	Top-down

Proposed Controls
	W=forward
	S=backward
	A=left
	D=right
	Mouse movement aims the pull/throw cross-hair
	Mouse 1 = Pull
	Mouse 2 = Throw
	Q=Cycle stored enemy ammo left
	E=Cycle stored enemy ammo right
	Spacebar=Boost or shield

Spaceship attributes
	Can move along x and y axies
	Left-click on an enemy to pull them into a power bar
	Right-click to throw the first enemy from the power bar to where the pull cursor is
	Ship has health bar. Can take a number of hits before losing a life. 3 seems like a good number

Full powerlist from enemies so far:
	Horizontal explosion
	Vertical explosion
	Gravity well to draw enemies in
	Circular explosion

Enemy Ideas
	Enemies should probably attack in a manner that resembles the power they give when thrown
		Circular explosion guy:
			Tries to fly up to the player's ship and detonates
			Flies eraticaly, like a crazy kamikaze piolt

		Carrier ship:
			Releases a number of circular explosion guys
			Can not be pulled, too big

		Horizontal explosion guy:
			Fires from the sides of the ships
			Flies in straight line horizontaly accross the screen

		Vertical explosion guy:
			Flies from the top of the screen to the bottom
			Fires his gun down in the same direction it moves

		Gravity well dude:
			Doesn't want to actually touch the player ship, instead flies near and activates a gravity well, pulling the players ship toward the Gravity well dude
			Basicaly just messes with the player's ability to move and dodge enemy fire

Visual Design
	Futureistic look and feel
		Space ship as main character
		Pull mechanic acomplished by tractor beam
		Scenery includes both space and land flights
	Mouse is visible as a stylized cursor for aiming pulls

Game progression
	After the tutorial level the game will branch into a multilevel design
		So level 1 is complete now choose which level to do next
		After all levels are done final boss level happens

	Killing each boss nets you some new power
		Proposed powers
			Shield
			Split-shot(All thrown enemies split into two of that type when thrown)
			Build-a-bomb(Combining any 3, 4 enemies generates a screen clearing bomb)
			Boost

	Killing a number of enemies causes the boss to spawn and attack
	Enemies fly-in in groups but not waves less galaga, more continuous
