	Top-down

Proposed Controls
	W=forward
	S=backward
	A=left
	D=right
	Mouse movement aims the pull/throw cross-hair
	Mouse 1 = Pull
	Mouse 2 = Throw
	Q=Cycle stored enemy ammo left
	E=Cycle stored enemy ammo right
	Spacebar=Boost or shield

Full powerlist from enemies so far:
	horizontal explosion
	gravity well to draw enemies in
	circular explosion

Enemy Ideas
	Enemies should probably attack in a manner that resembles the power they give when thrown
		The circular explosion guy could fly up to and detonate near you
		

Visual Design
	Futureistic look and feel
		Space ship as main character
		Pull mechanic acomplished by tractor beam
		Scenery includes both space and land flights

Game progression
	After the tutorial level the game will branch into a multilevel design
		So level 1 is complete now choose which level to do next
		After all levels are done final boss level happens(maybe)
	Killing each boss nets you some new power
		Proposed powers
			Shield
			Split-shot(All thrown enemies split into two of that type when thrown)
			Build-a-bomb(Combining any 3, 4 enemies generates a screen clearing bomb)
			Boost

	Killing a number of enemies causes the boss to spawn and attack
